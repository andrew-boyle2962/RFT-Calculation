# Resistive Force Theory Calculation

This project aims to calculate the resistive force on a tool/body moving through granular material as per the work of Li et al (2013) - [Link](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1229163).

The end goal is to have an interface to input a tool (e.g. from a cad file), define the free surface height (or profile) of the granular material, and from that calculate the forces acting on the tool.

Improvements to the theory such as that used in Tsuchiya et al (2020) - [Link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002248982030001X) - will eventually also be included.

# Usage

Current - Define your tool shape in SurfaceIntegration.py and run. Follow other lines of code to see how to pass in to the main function.
