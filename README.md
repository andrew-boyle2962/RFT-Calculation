# Resistive Force Theory Calculation

This project aims to calculate the resistive force on a tool/body moving through granular material as per the work of Li et al (2013) - https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002248982030001X.

The end goal is to have an interface to input a tool (e.g. from a cad file), define the free surface height (or profile) of the granular material, and from that calculate the forces acting on the tool.
